# Accessible-Messaging
A multilingual text-to-speech application for push notifications, using voice-recognition.

### Description
When a smartphone lets us know that it has received a new message, as someone who can see it, you can
read the notification, go to the app and reply. However by relying on voice commands and screen readers to navigate
a phone, it is often not possible to know from which application the notification was sent and what the content of the
message was, especially if it is from a 3rd party. Your task is to create a way for visually impaired users to have easy
access to their notifications on their phone and read them.

### Repo Instructions
Hello everyone! We will go over this in our next meeting but I can put it here just for future
reference. We will need everyone to create a local version of this repo on their machines in
order to edit the project files. Along with this, we will be creating our own git branches to work
new features and versions of the project. This is to avoid pushing un-tested or un-finished code onto
the 'master' branch where the working project will exist. If anyone wants to create a local repo right now,
I just posted some quick instructions (though I'm pretty sure everyone already knows how to so sorry if this isn't needed)

1. create a new folder for the project
2. navigate to the folder in terminal
3. command 'git init'
4. command 'git 
5. command 'git remote add origin https://github.com/GNGB34/Accessible-Messaging.git'
6. command 'git fetch'
